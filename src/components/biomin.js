               Integrated landfill mining is a new solution to address the alarming need to treat legacy waste that has been buried or dumped for years. 
               A bio- mining process is a waste treatment landfill with technology that accelerates the reclamation of land where in the waste is segregated and the resources are reclaimed from the waste that has been dumped for many years. The technology aims at stabilizing, processing, segregating and responsibly disposing the aggregates thus reclaiming the land
               This provides a high efficiency and low-cost extraction process. Bio-mining is more environmentally friendly than other processing methods such as smelting or roasting, which is one of the key advantages.
               Resolve the effects caused by the legacy waste and reclaim the land through our experts using proven technology. Earth Recycler teamed with up New Age Environment Solutions is on the forefront of biomining landfill development. We currently operate ten full-scale waste.
